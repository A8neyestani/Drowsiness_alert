# Drowsiness Alert in Driving

Drowsiness and fatigue while driving can have fatal consequences. This project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect drowsiness in real-time by monitoring the eyes. Once detected, it sends visual alerts to the user.

## Features
- Real-time detection of eyes using facial landmarks.
- Visual alert messages to draw attention to drowsy behavior.
- Uses MediaPipe's solution for efficient face mesh detection.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## How to use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure your environment satisfies the prerequisites.
3. Run the main script.
4. To quit the application, press the 'q' key.
